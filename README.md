### Prerequisites
- *XAMPP*: Download and install from [Apache Friends](https://www.apachefriends.org/).
- *Git*: Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

### Step-by-Step Setup
1. *Clone the Repository*:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to clone the NotesHub repo:
     bash
     git clone https://github.com/shivamnanavare/NotesHub-v0).git
     
   - Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username or the correct repo URL.

2. *Move Project to XAMPP*:
   - Copy the cloned notes-hub folder to the htdocs directory in your XAMPP installation (e.g., C:\xampp\htdocs\ on Windows).
   - The project should now be in C:\xampp\htdocs\notes-hub\.

3. *Start XAMPP*:
   - Open the XAMPP Control Panel.
   - Start the *Apache* and *MySQL* modules.

4. *Set Up the Database*:
   - Open your browser and go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin.
   - Create a new database named noteshub_db.
   - Import the provided SQL file (database/notes_website.sql) from the project folder:
     - Click on the notes_website database.
     - Go to the *Import* tab, choose the .sql file, and click *Go*.

5. *Update Database Credentials*:
   - Open the config.php file in the project folder (e.g., notes-hub/config.php).
   - Update the database connection settings if needed (default settings for XAMPP):
     php
     $host = "localhost";
     $username = "root";
     $password = "";
     $database = "notes_website";
     

6. *Launch the Application*:
   - Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost/notes-hub/.
   - You should see the NotesHub homepage.
   - Register a new account or log in to start using the platform.

### Troubleshooting
- *Apache/MySQL not starting?* Check if ports 80 (Apache) or 3306 (MySQL) are in use by other apps (e.g., Skype).
- *Database errors?* Ensure the .sql file was imported correctly and credentials in config.php match your setup.
- *404 errors?* Confirm the project folder is in htdocs and the URL is correct.
